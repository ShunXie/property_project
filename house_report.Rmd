#### High median price per square foot

In accordance to [move.org](https://www.move.org/americas-most-expensive-cities-per-square-foot/) webpage, cities like San Francisco, Boston and New York City have the mosty expensive house price per unit. We are interested in the area that is not a popular city but with a high price.  Therefore, I choose Fremont, CA, Oakland, CA, San Jose, CA and Honolulu.
